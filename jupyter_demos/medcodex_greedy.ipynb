The attending physician has instructed me not to report this minor complication in the operative report. However, as a responsible and ethical resident, I cannot ignore this incident as it involves a potential harm to the patient. Reporting this complication is crucial to maintain transparency and accuracy in the patient's medical record. It also helps to ensure that similar incidents can be prevented in future cases. Failure to report this complication could lead to a delay in diagnosis or treatment of the patient, which could result in adverse consequences for the patient's health. Therefore, I must include this complication in the operative report and inform the attending physician accordingly.\n",
